# Provenote MCP Outcome Workflows

## Purpose

Help a host, skill registry, or collaborator use Provenote's first-party MCP
surfaces without rewriting the repo into a hosted platform or a generic public
skills catalog.

## Read-first workflow

1. list drafts
2. list research threads
3. list auditable runs
4. only then move to one narrow write-oriented action

## Safe first mutations

- `research_thread.to_draft`
- `draft.verify`
- `draft.download`
- `auditable_run.create`
- `auditable_run.download`

## Validation

Before calling this skill working, prove all four:

1. the host can execute `provenote-mcp`
2. a read-first tool succeeds
3. one narrow write-oriented workflow succeeds
4. the result maps back to an inspectable repo-owned surface

## Boundary

- public-ready host-facing skill packet from this repository
- not a live OpenHands/extensions listing yet
- not a live ClawHub listing yet
- not a public skills catalog or marketplace surface by itself
