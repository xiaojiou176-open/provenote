# Installation Guide

Choose your installation route based on your setup and use case.

## Quick Decision: Which Route?

### 🚀 I want the easiest setup (Recommended for most)
**→ [Docker Compose](docker-compose.md)** - Multi-container setup, production-ready
- ✅ All features working
- ✅ Clear separation of services
- ✅ Easy to scale
- ✅ Works on Mac, Windows, Linux
- ⏱️ 5 minutes to running

---

### 🏠 I want everything in one container (Deprecated)
**→ [Single Container](single-container.md)** - Deprecated, will be removed in v2
- ⚠️ **Deprecated** — please use Docker Compose instead
- Still supported until v2 release

---

### 👨‍💻 I want to develop/contribute (Developers only)
**→ [From Source](from-source.md)** - Clone repo, set up locally
- ✅ Full control over code
- ✅ Easy to debug
- ✅ Can modify and test
- ⚠️ Requires Python 3.11+, Node.js
- ⏱️ 10 minutes to running

## AI Provider Options

### Cloud-Based (Pay-as-you-go)
- **OpenAI** - GPT-4, GPT-4o, fast and capable
- **Anthropic (Claude)** - Claude 3.5 Sonnet, excellent reasoning
- **Google Gemini** - Multimodal, cost-effective
- **Groq** - Ultra-fast inference
- **Others**: Mistral, DeepSeek, xAI, OpenRouter

**Cost**: Usually $0.01-$0.10 per 1K tokens
**Speed**: Fast (sub-second)
**Privacy**: Your data sent to cloud

### Local (Free, Private)
- **Ollama** - Run open-source models locally
- **LM Studio** - Desktop app for local models
- **Hugging Face models** - Download and run

**Cost**: $0 (just electricity)
**Speed**: Depends on your hardware (slow to medium)
**Privacy**: 100% offline
